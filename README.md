# Kanye-Weather



## Description:

This is a simple, browser-based, weather app that aims to keep Ye fans informed of the weather by enticing them with a random Ye quote. It includes a localstorage counter that is displayed on the page that gives the user a better idea of how often they are checking the weather. 

### User Story:

AS a Ye fan I would like to receive motivation to check the weather more frequently,
SO I will be armed with the necessary information to prepare myself and my belongings before going outdoors.

### Why we chose this project and what we learned:

- **Amara Briquelet:** I thought it would be fun to make an app that mixes an extremely useful API with one that is purely for entertainment purposes. 
My main takeaways from working on this project:
- Don't get feature happy unless MVP is achieved early, if a functionality can be added without adding an extra API do it without adding it to avoid inconsistent results. 
- How to coordinate with other devs on a team. 
- **Mark Homchik:** I enjoyed working on my first team project with a group. It was very interesting to see how all of our minds put together can make one small or big project work.
My main takeaways and things I learned:
- Ask questions. A lot of them, if you can't figure something out the best possible thing to do is to ask questions.
- Learned how to communicate productively even when everyone is far away or has different time zones

### Directions for Future Development:

- Replace getcurrentlocation with a search bar (preferably one with autocomplete that can pull cities with the same name in different countries/states) that allows the user to look up the weather anywhere in the world.

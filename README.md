# Kanye-Weather

## Description:

This is a simple, browser-based, weather app that aims to keep Ye fans informed of the weather by enticing them with a random Ye quote. It includes a localstorage counter that is displayed on the page that gives the user a better idea of how often they are checking the weather. 

### User Story:

AS a Ye fan I would like to receive motivation to check the weather more frequently,
SO I will be armed with the necessary information to prepare myself and my belongings before going outdoors.
